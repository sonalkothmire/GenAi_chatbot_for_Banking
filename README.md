# RBI Financial & Operations Risk Guidelines Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions related to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Financial and Operations Risk Guidelines. The system uses a FAISS vector store to retrieve context from ingested documents and leverages an OpenAI language model (via LangChain) to generate concise, bullet-pointed responses. A Flask App frontend provides a user-friendly web interface.
